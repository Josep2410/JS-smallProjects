Image scroller project. Use the arrows button on screen to change display of images

12/21/22: Still need to figure out how to remove the left and right images when the screen becomes smaller
12/22/22: Decided to abandon responsive design, and focus on desktop screen use
12/23/22: Going to start on an upgraded version of the current design => scroller 2.0
ALERT: original design is not captured by screens that are not 1880px x 882px //(w x h)
